Hey Dee! I’m developing an app for whop and have some questions on the integrations based on the whop infrastructure. Do you have any idea of whom I could contact? I’ve tried reaching out to some people on X who are in the engineering team but havent had any luck with responses. Any help would be amazing!

Hey! 

This is my department! So, ask away!

Oct 28, 2025 5:23 PM
Hey Dee! I am in the process of trying to build a course generator app within whop. I have the app set up to upload a PDF, then have AI generate the course and all the content. I have one question related to being able to publish these courses within the Whop courses app. Is it possible for this to occur with the current Whop infrastructure? Currently once I try to publish them, they are added to the whop courses app, to move the module to a course, but when I try to do this, they are not being moved. Is this even possible??

Can you clarify a little more? What’s happening with moving modules? 

So once my app creates the course, I’m trying to move them into the whop courses app via the API. They appear to be actually added because the one image says I have 13 modules that I can move into the who courses app. I then hit start and try to move the module, but they are not actually being moved. I’m not sure if this is something that I am doing incorrectly or what.

How are you creating courses?

Might be na issue with moving modules 

But even so why do that in the first place instead of just creating modules themselves 

Oct 29, 2025 7:30 AM
Heres a detailed breakdown of the current process!

Oct 29, 2025 3:21 PM
if I create the course under an experience, is it able to be moved into the whop courses app? Or should i not create the course under an experience, and try to move it into the courses app that way?

you should choose the experience the given course you want to add to is already in

so under an experience, they cant be moved to the whop courses app? the user would have to view it under the experience that populates in the sidebar?

essentially, if you want to add another module, select a pre-existing course experience and add it there 

if you specify a new experience it will create a new course 

that would show up in the whop courses app, correct?

Whichever one, you select yes. A creator can have multiple 

okay i am lost lol I have tried Attempt 1: Without Attaching to Product

Created an Experience using POST to /api/v1/experiences

Provided: app_id, company_id, name

Result: Got back experience_id

Created Courses (modules) using POST to /api/v1/courses

Provided: experience_id, title, tagline

Result: Got back course_id for each module

Created Chapters using POST to /api/v1/course_chapters

Provided: course_id, title

Result: Got back chapter_id for each chapter

Created Lessons using POST to /api/v1/course_lessons

Provided: chapter_id, lesson_type, title, content

Result: Got back lesson_id for each lesson

Problem: Courses were created successfully but didn't appear in the Whop Courses app sidebar




Guess this is what I get for vibe coding lol

omg 

okay, let me ask you this. Is your app used in a contest a creator would already have a course?

*context

No the idea was that my app would generate the course material off of say a pdf or something. Then publish it to the whop courses app. Thats what my plan was lol

Looking at the new api, I thought it could be possible

okay, so basically this creator would have a pre-existing courses app already. This means your app wants to first retrieve that specific course (by course id) and then add to it.

You’d start here ^ grab a course id 

then create a chapter inside of the id you fetched: https://docs.whop.com/api-reference/course-chapters/create-course-chapter

then subsequently lessons: https://docs.whop.com/api-reference/course-lessons/create-course-lesson

Omg. I’m an idiot…. They would just have to go in, create a course. Then mine would add the content.

Yes, though just to clarify, this endpoint did not make a courses app on the sidebar?



https://docs.whop.com/api-reference/courses/create-course

@Zachary Salyers just gave @Dee a "Helpful" badge.

I don’t really want that. I just wanted it mainly in the courses app. That is what Claude was saying the best approach was is creating an experience
